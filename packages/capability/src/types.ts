/**
 * The Capability IR, field for field the shape of `capability-ir.schema.json`.

 * The shape is ASIL's (Agent-Software Interaction Layer, arXiv 2608.26991): a structured

 * and the granularity decision that Patchlet adds.
 *
 * The schema is the single source of truth. This type mirrors it by hand and `test/types.test.ts`
 * proves the two agree: typed examples must validate, and every property name the schema declares
