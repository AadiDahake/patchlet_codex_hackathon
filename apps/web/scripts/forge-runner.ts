/**
 * The forge runner: the long-lived process that carries forge work.
 *
 * A forge run is minutes of sandbox work and a decision waits on a merge and a Vercel deployment.
 * Neither fits inside a serverless function, so the console's routes only write the `escalation`
 * row and answer. This process polls those rows and does the work, exactly as
 * `services/worker/local_runner.py` does for the `local` engine. The console and the widget read
 * the same `trace_event` rows either way, so nothing else changes.
 *
 *   pch-exec npm run forge:runner
 *
 * Each claimed row runs on its own promise, because a run that is waiting on a deployment must
 * not hold up the next one. Stop it with Ctrl-C; a row it was carrying is left where it got to,
 * and `npm run forge:sweep` shuts down any devbox it left behind.
