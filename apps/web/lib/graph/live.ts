/**
 * The page in front of the visitor, as part of the map for the length of one turn.
 *
 * The product map is what a route is planned over, so until a page is on it, a control the
 * visitor can see is a control the agent cannot point at. That is a race the visitor always
 * loses: the map is written at the start of the turn but read beside it, it is cached for a few
 * seconds per process, and a page from another origin is never written at all
 * (`lib/graph/origin.ts`). The button that shipped this morning was on screen and unmentionable.
 *
 * So the turn plans over the stored map with the live page merged into it, in memory and for that
 * turn only. Nothing here writes: what a scan is allowed to teach the map is still decided by
 * `belongsToSite`, and a control that arrived this way carries a `live:` id so it is never
 * mistaken for a stored row.
