-- The NO branch, upgraded: the evidence behind an opportunity and the specification compiled
-- from it.
--
-- A feature_request_group is still the opportunity. What is new is the behavioural evidence
-- mined for it (one `trajectory` row per PostHog session), the Capability IR the compiler
-- produced from that evidence (`capability_spec`), and the queue that carries one run of the
-- pipeline from "the turn ended absent" to "the specification is stored" (`discovery`).
--
-- `candidate` and `deployment_outcome` are migration 0014's. The foreign keys that point from
-- 0014's columns at `capability_spec` live in migration 0015, so the schema is the same whether
-- this file ran before or after 0014.

-- Behavioural evidence for one opportunity, mined from PostHog. One row per session.
