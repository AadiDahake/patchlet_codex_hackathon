# Contributing to Patchlet

Guidance for anyone working in this repository, human or automated. Read `docs/contracts.md`
before changing anything that crosses a boundary.

## Layout

| Path | Owns |
|---|---|
| `packages/shared` | Types and pure helpers shared by the widget, the web app and the tests. Zero runtime dependencies. |
| `packages/capability` | The capability compiler: user workflows in, a validated Capability IR out. Pure TypeScript; see "The capability compiler stays pure". |
| `packages/widget` | The embeddable script. Builds to a single IIFE at `dist/patchlet.js`, copied into `apps/web/public/widget.js`. |
| `apps/web` | The Next.js dashboard: landing page, console, and every HTTP route. |
| `services/worker` | The Python escalation worker. Independent toolchain (`uv`), independent tests. |
| `supabase/migrations` | Schema. Additive migrations only after the first release. |
| `scripts` | Node maintenance scripts run through the root `package.json`. |
| `docs` | The plan, architecture, contracts, the forge engine, demo notes, deploy notes. |

`docs/PLAN.md` is what the product is for. Read it before changing anything a demo beat depends on.
`docs/guidance.md` is how a question becomes a walk on the page: the site graph, the planner, the
knowledge base, and the measurements that hold them to account.

## The contracts file

`docs/contracts.md` holds the data model, the shared TypeScript types, the HTTP API, the agent's
behaviour and the model ids. Several parts of the system are built against it in parallel, so it
wins over local preference. If you need to change a contract, change `docs/contracts.md` and the
code that depends on it in the same commit.

## One provider, two modules

Every model call in `apps/web` goes through `apps/web/lib/openai.ts`, and every model call in the
worker goes through `services/worker/steps/llm.py`. Model ids live in `@patchlet/shared` (`MODELS`,
`EFFORT`) and in `steps/llm.py`, nowhere else, so changing a model is one edit and the provider
stays swappable. Section 5 of `docs/contracts.md` records each choice, the reason and the date.

Tests never reach the network. Mock the provider at the module boundary, as
`apps/web/test/openai.test.ts` does with the `openai` package itself.

## Who a request belongs to

An account owns exactly one project (`project.owner_id`), and that project is the whole tenant:
its sources, conversations, escalations, trace and repository binding.

- Console routes and pages resolve the caller through `apps/web/lib/console/current.ts` and scope
  every query to the project id it returns. Never resolve a project any other way there.
- Widget routes (`/api/chat`, `/api/escalate`, `/api/transcribe`, `/api/speak`, and the widget's
  escalation poll) resolve by the public `embed_key` instead, because they run on a customer's
  site with no session.
- The worker scopes by `escalation.project_id` and prefers the project's linked GitHub token over
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`services/worker/steps/github_token.py`).

## An engine that cannot run refuses at the boundary

`ESCALATION_ENGINE` names what builds the change. `local` is the worker's runner. `forge` is the
sandbox engine in `apps/web/lib/forge` (`docs/forge.md`): `forgeAvailability()` checks the selected
strategy's keys, and `POST /api/escalate` answers `503` and writes nothing when they are missing
rather than queueing a row no runner will claim. Any engine added later follows the same rule -
refuse before the first write, never after it.

## An approved issue outranks the target repository's premise

The worker's architect reads the target repository's own `AGENTS.md` before it plans anything, and a
product repository can hold a convention, a contract or a test whose whole content is that the
requested feature is absent. NovaAir is one: it has the seat primitives and a guard test that fails
if anything composes them. Read as instructions those forbid the change, and the architect answered
with an empty file list and quoted the convention back.

A human accepted the request in the console before the run started, so that premise is what the
change supersedes. `services/worker/steps/codegen.py` says so in the prompt, a planned file carries
an action (`edit`, `create`, `delete`) so a guard can be removed, the strict schema requires at least
one file, and an empty answer is retried once and then raises with the model's own words. Everything
else in the target's conventions still binds: only the absence claim is superseded, never the
engineering standard around it. Do not soften this by editing the target repository instead.

## The capability compiler stays pure

`packages/capability` has one rule: no network, no database, no framework imports. It never
imports Supabase, Next, the `openai` package or `fetch`. Trajectories go in, a validated IR comes
out, and the model is an injected `ModelClient` interface that the caller supplies. That is what
makes every test in the package run offline against `test/fixtures/sessions.json`, and what makes
`npm run compile -- --fixtures` demonstrable with no key and no database. The four stages, the
research each one credits, and the IR fields are in `docs/capability-compiler.md`.

## The opportunity pipeline

`apps/web/lib/opportunity` is what runs between the absence verdict and the forge engine: mine the
sessions from PostHog, compile the Capability IR, store it, and tell the chat how many others hit
the gap. Three rules, all in `docs/opportunities.md`:

- A request enqueues a `discovery` row and answers at once; it never runs the pipeline before the
  response. `DISCOVERY_MODE` decides whether this process runs the row afterwards (`inline`, a
  laptop) or `npm run discover:runner` does (`runner`, a host that caps requests). Statuses are
  `queued`, `running`, `done`, `failed`; one active row per group.
- `apps/web/lib/posthog` is the only module that holds the PostHog personal API key. Every query
  is named, filters the window first and scans `events` once; `OFFSET` is never used.
- The pipeline's trace rows carry `source: "forge"` and the group id, and the two lines the chat
  shows carry `source: "agent"` on the conversation. `npm run tail` renders the same stream.
- A console page never evaluates `@patchlet/capability` (its modules read prompt files through
  `import.meta.url`, which the page layer lacks at build time). Pages and components import it as
  types only; anything a page needs rendered, the pipeline renders and stores on the row.

## The forge engine

`apps/web/lib/forge` is the only place that knows Reflex and Runloop exist. The engine
(`engine.ts`) takes explicit dependencies: a `SandboxStrategy` (`reflex.ts`, `runloop.ts`,
`local.ts`, or the tests' fake), a `ForgeStore` (Supabase or memory), and the personas. Keep it
that way: nothing in the engine reads the environment, so a script and a test can run it whole.
Every path that creates a sandbox tears it down in a `finally`; the one box that outlives a run is
the winner's, and its handle (never a URL) is on the `candidate` row. The persona prompts are the
Markdown files in `lib/forge/prompts/`; a change to one is a change to what Codex builds, so it is
reviewed like code. `npm run forge:local -- --spec <ir.json> --no-push` runs the whole engine on
this machine with no database; `npm run forge:sweep` shuts down devboxes a crash left behind.

No forge work happens inside an HTTP request. A run is tens of minutes and Vercel's hobby plan caps
a serverless function at 300 s, so the routes write the `escalation` row and answer `202`, and
`npm run forge:runner` polls those rows and carries the work, as
`services/worker/local_runner.py` does for the `local` engine. Keep `export const maxDuration` at
or under 300 in every route: a higher value fails the production deploy, and it is a sign the work
belongs in a runner. See "Where a run actually runs" in `docs/forge.md`.

## TypeScript

- `strict: true` everywhere, inherited from `tsconfig.base.json`. No `any` in checked-in code.
- Prefer narrow types at boundaries and widen inwards, not the other way round.
- Shared types live in `@patchlet/shared`. Do not redeclare them locally.

## Model output is untrusted

Anything a model returns is input from outside the system. Validate and coerce it at the boundary,
never cast it. Concretely:

- Parse JSON responses into a checked shape before use; on a mismatch, degrade (drop the steps, keep
  the prose) rather than throwing at the user.
- A step plan is only valid if every `target` is an affordance id the widget actually sent, which is
  what `validatePlan` enforces. Ids are opaque handles, never selectors.
- Never interpolate model output into SQL, a shell command, or a file path. The worker's file
  applier guards against path traversal for exactly this reason.
- Never render model output as HTML.

## Not every message is a support request

Every message is classified before anything is searched (`apps/web/lib/agent/understand.ts`, the
table in section 4 of `docs/contracts.md`): `chat`, `page`, `product` or `mixed`. Only `product`
and `mixed` run the three checks, the verdict and the absence path. A greeting and a question the
page already answers are answered directly in `apps/web/lib/agent/direct.ts`, with no probe, no
verdict and nothing offered to report, because there is nothing missing to report.

Three rules make that safe, and they hold for anything added here later:

- A direct answer never names a control the widget did not send, and never says the product has a
  feature. A capability is asserted from a probe hit or not at all.
- Unsure is `mixed`, never `chat`: the class that still checks its evidence is the safe default,
  and it is where every unreadable classification lands.
- The classifier's prompt carries three examples of each class and the fixtures in
  `apps/web/test/fixtures/intents.ts` hold it to them. `understand.live.test.ts` runs them against
  the real model and skips itself without a key; change the prompt and run it.

## Only the site the project names teaches the product map

The map is what a route is planned over, so a control on it is a control the agent will tell a
visitor to press. A preview deployment of an unmerged branch serves the same product on another
origin, and one question asked on one of its pages used to add its controls to the live project's
map and pin a `known_route` to them; every visitor on the live site was then walked to a button
that is not there.

`belongsToSite` in `apps/web/lib/graph/origin.ts` is the one rule: a scan whose origin differs from
the origin of the project's `site_url` writes nothing - no page, no affordance, no transition, no
known route - and the turn still answers from that page's live controls. A project with no
`site_url` has not said where it lives, so every scan is taken. Both doors into the map obey it:
the turn's page-join and `POST /api/site/observe`. Anything added later that writes to the map
follows the same rule.

`npm run demo:reset` clears `known_route` with the rest, because a remembered route answers a
question before a single check runs and would otherwise pin the last run's answer to the next one.

That rule is about what the map learns, never about what the visitor is told. The page a question
was asked on is merged into the map the turn plans over (`mapWithCurrentPage` in
`apps/web/lib/graph/live.ts`), in memory and for that turn only, so a control the visitor can see
is always a control the answer may point at - whatever the origin, whatever the graph cache holds,
and whether or not the page has ever been written down. Nothing about that merge writes, and no
project lookup is cached anywhere, so a `site_url` change takes effect on the next request.
`docs/guidance.md` has the run this rule comes from.

## A GitHub issue is opened by a person, and only ever one per gap

Filing in the customer's repository is an outward action. The only thing that authorises it is a
visitor accepting "Report to developers"; `noteRequest` records the group for the opportunity
dashboard and starts no run, so a question the visitor then says was not needed leaves nothing
behind in anyone's repository.

The reported gap is then one issue however the runs overlap. Two runs for one group can both read
a group whose `issue_number` is still null, so `services/worker/steps/pipeline.py` claims
`feature_request_group.issue_claim` with one conditional update before filing; the loser waits for
the winner's number and comments on that issue. Section 4 of `docs/contracts.md` has the table.

## A blip on the wire is not a verdict on the request

Every Supabase and GitHub call in `services/worker` goes through `steps/retry.py`: a dropped
connection or a "not now" status is retried a few times, and an answer about the request itself (a
404, a 422) is returned untouched. `pipeline.fail` never marks a run failed while its pull request
is open, writes the failure into the trace in words a person can act on, leaves the issue open and
puts the group back in a state a later report can start from.

## A route is only ever planned to a control that does the thing

`coversCapability` in `@patchlet/shared` is the one rule behind every "is this the control for it"
decision: a label accounts for a capability when it carries all of a one or two concept capability,
or all but one of a longer one, reading the control's own accessible name and never the title of
the page it sits on. The interface check, the capabilities check and the candidates a route may be
planned to all import it, so they cannot drift apart. A control is a candidate when its name covers
the capability, or when a documentation passage names it and the documentation check says that
passage covers the question. There is no third door, and nothing else is put in front of the model
to choose from.

When the three checks agree that nothing does this, the turn says so and offers the report. The
page planner is the last resort and the rule binds it twice: it is never reached while a control
the visitor can see does what was asked, because that control is the answer in one step, and the
walk it writes is kept only when the last step lands on a control that passes one of the two doors
(`planEndsOnCapability`). Without that, a model handed a seat map plans a walk through a
capability the product has not got. `docs/guidance.md` has the runs this rule comes from.

## Guiding a user on their own page

The widget watches the host page; it never drives it. The plan it walks is a route over the site
graph (`docs/guidance.md`): the server resolves the question to one control, computes the path
from the current page, and the count it announces is the length of that path. Four rules keep the
walk honest, and each has a regression test in `packages/widget/test`:

- A step is bound by identity, never by position. The scan numbers affordances positionally, so a
  re-render can point the same id at a different control; the machine binds every step by role,
  accessible name, landmark and link target (`controlKey` in `@patchlet/shared`), with the old id
  only as a tie-break.
- The announced total never changes during a successful walk. After the last step the machine is
  done; it does not ask the server whether anything is left. Only when a control is absent after
  a re-scan and one more look after the page settles does it ask `POST /api/chat` with
  `continueFrom`, and then it says plainly that the route changed and shows the new count.
- A press is success. `pointerdown` on the spotlit control advances a click or navigation step;
  menus and dialogs dismiss on `pointerdown` and unmount their trigger, so the `click` that would
  have confirmed the action never has a node to fire on.
- Nothing is ever bound or drawn against an empty or off-screen rect (`guide/geometry.ts`). A
  detached node still answers `getBoundingClientRect` with zeros, and a caption anchored to one
  lands in the top-left corner pointing at nothing. Treat it as lost and re-bind instead.

The widget also teaches the graph: `guide/transitions.ts` remembers the control a visitor pressed
and reports the page they landed on to `POST /api/site/observe`, once per route and move per
session. The continuation in `apps/web/lib/agent/continue.ts` recomputes the route over the graph
with no model; a model reads the page only when the graph has no route from it.

## When the widget speaks

Never in text mode. The microphone in the composer is dictation: it types the question and the
answer comes back as text. Audio only plays during a call, and `ui/call.ts` is the one place that
decides it (`shouldSpeak`, `shouldListen`); the recorder and the player know nothing about calls
and are driven from those two answers. Both the call machine and the event-to-status mapping in
`ui/status.ts` are pure and covered by `packages/widget/test/call.test.ts` and `status.test.ts`.

The status line under the typing dots comes from real `probe` and `verdict` events, but it is
paced: the three checks run in parallel and land together, so without a dwell the line would jump
from the first stage to the last.

## Secrets

No literal secrets anywhere, including tests and fixtures. Every credential is read from the
environment through a typed accessor (`apps/web/lib/env.ts`) that fails with the variable's name
when it is missing. `.env.example` lists names and one-line descriptions only. The widget and the
console pages never see an API key; the only public identifier is the project's embed key.

## Style

- Small files, one concern each. If a file needs a section comment to be navigable, split it.
- Clear names over short names. Comments explain why, not what.
- No em dashes. Use a plain dash.
- Status is text, not a coloured pill. See the design notes in `docs/architecture.md`.
- Every colour, radius, shadow and blur is a token in `apps/web/app/globals.css`; the widget has
  its own copy in `packages/widget/src/styles.ts`. Use the classes there rather than styling a
  page on its own, and never write a literal colour in a component.

## Commits

## Running things

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # dashboard on http://localhost:3000
npm run build        # widget, then copy, then web
npm run typecheck    # must pass before you push
npm test             # must pass before you push
npm run db:migrate   # apply supabase/migrations/*.sql in order
npm run db:seed      # idempotent seed, prints the embed key when it creates one
node scripts/screenshots.mjs pages <dir> name=url...   # 1440x900 captures, private headless Chromium
npm run seed:site    # explore the project's site into the product map and import its help center
npm run eval:docs    # the offline set that tunes the documentation check, against a running site
npm run e2e:guide    # the guided walk on NovaAir, against the widget's mock API or a running stack
npm run discover:runner -- --once     # drain the discovery queue; --model codex compiles on the saved Codex login
PATCHLET_CONSOLE_TOKEN=... npm run tail   # the evidence loop as a board in the terminal
npm run ask:live -- "<question>" [home|trip|seats]   # the live site, answered by this working tree
```

Screenshots come from `scripts/screenshots.mjs` (Playwright, one private browser per run), never
from a shared browser session. `docs/screenshots/` holds the captures a pull request refers to.

Anything that needs credentials expects them in the environment. Supply them with your own secret
manager rather than a file in the working tree.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request and on every push to `main`. Two jobs run in
parallel. `web` uses Node 22 and runs `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` and
`npm run build`. `worker` uses Python 3.12 with `uv` and runs `uv sync --frozen` and
`uv run --frozen pytest` in `services/worker`. Both jobs run with no secrets, so a fork's pull
request is checked the same way as a branch; if a change makes the build need a variable, give it a
safe placeholder in the workflow and teach the code to treat that placeholder as "not configured".
One concurrency group per ref cancels the run a new push supersedes.

Run the same commands locally before you push:

```bash
npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build
cd services/worker && uv sync --frozen && uv run --frozen pytest
```

A dev run leaves the tree clean, and it has to stay that way: `next dev` must end with
`git status --porcelain` empty. Next generates `apps/web/next-env.d.ts` on both `next dev` and
`next build` and writes a different path into it for each, so the file is generated, not committed.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file short and durable. Record only what almost every future contributor needs. For
anything the codebase already states, link to the authoritative file or command instead of copying
the detail here. Update it in the same commit as the change it describes.
