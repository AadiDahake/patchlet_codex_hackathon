# Architecture

## The shape of the system

Patchlet is one embeddable script, one Next.js app, one Postgres database, one Python worker, and
one behavioural evidence layer. The evidence layer is PostHog, and the loop runs through it twice.
Before the pull request, PostHog says how many other customers worked around the same gap and what
they did instead. After the launch, PostHog says whether the change actually solved it.

                               apps/web /console
```

Every stage on that path also writes a `trace_event` row, so `/api/trace/stream` replays the whole
story live on the console's Activity page.

Nothing in the browser holds a credential. The widget carries a public embed key that identifies a
project and nothing else; every model, analytics and repository call happens server-side. The
PostHog personal API key stays on the server, and the only PostHog key on the host page is the
customer's own project key in their own `posthog-js` install.

## The evidence loop

The story is not "PostHog data goes in, an AI writes a pull request". It is four stages, always in
this order, and the middle two are Patchlet's own work.

```text
user workflows  ->  inferred intent  ->  semantic capability  ->  verified implementation
```

**1. User workflows.** The host product loads `posthog-js` with session recording and a small
explicit event contract. When the three checks prove a feature is absent, Patchlet asks the second
question: is this one person, or a pattern? It queries PostHog's HogQL endpoint for historical
sessions with similar behaviour and pulls the matching recordings, which gives one row per session
with its ordered steps. That is the raw material: real people already achieving the goal the hard
way. The mining query and the PostHog client are `apps/web/lib/posthog`; the pipeline that runs
them and the compiler for one request group is `apps/web/lib/opportunity`, enqueued by the turn
that ended `absent` and executed off the request (`docs/opportunities.md`).

**2. Inferred intent.** `packages/capability` reads each session as a demonstration and recovers
the goal behind it, following OS-Genesis reverse task synthesis. Every step becomes one line of
prose with no model call, then batches of sessions are lifted to one goal each, and a reward model
grades every trajectory on completion and coherence. A session that wandered and then succeeded
scores high on completion and low on coherence, and that pairing is the workaround signal.
Trajectories are kept with a weight rather than filtered to the winners.

**3. Semantic capability.** The same package picks the granularity, using ToolCUA's bottom-up
merging and grounding, and shapes the answer as ASIL does: structured state, semantic actions,
constraints, success criteria. It merges adjacent steps at four levels, scores each candidate on
support, steps replaced, next-state grounding and argument semantics, and takes the largest merge
that is still grounded. That is what yields `seat_party_together`, not `clickSeat` below it and not
`manage_trip` above it. The result is a Capability IR validated against a JSON schema, or a
reasoned `none` when no capability is warranted.

**4. Verified implementation.** The IR, the host repository and the acceptance scenarios go into
isolated sandboxes. Reflex Automations and Personas orchestrate the run, Runloop devboxes hold the
candidates, and Codex does the implementation inside them: read the repository, find the existing
primitives, build the capability and its UI, write tests, fix failures. The verifier persona runs
the scenarios the compiler derived, the winning candidate produces a preview, and a person merges
the draft pull request or does not. This is the `forge` engine, and `apps/web/lib/forge` owns it.

Then PostHog again. The same events that exposed the gap now measure the fix: adoption, completion,
dropoff and support volume, before and after the launch. The answer either closes the loop or
starts the next one.

`docs/capability-compiler.md` is the compiler in full, stage by stage, with the research each stage
credits and the IR field by field. `docs/PLAN.md` is the demo the whole loop is built for.

## The site graph

Patchlet keeps a map of the host product: pages as routes, controls identified by role,
accessible name, landmark and link target (never a selector), and transitions that say which
control on which page led to which page, or revealed which control on the same page. The
explorer fills it once with a headless browser running the widget's own scanner; the widget keeps
it current from every page it scans and every move a visitor makes. The console's "Product map"
page shows it. `docs/guidance.md` has the design and the measurements.

## One chat turn

A question travels through a fixed pipeline. Every stage emits an SSE `ChatEvent` to the widget and
writes a `trace_event` row so the console can replay the same reasoning live.

1. **Recall.** The page joins the graph, and the question's intent is looked up among the known
   routes. A question asked before resolves to its control, the route from this page is read off
   the graph, and the answer streams at once with no model call.
2. **Understand.** A small fast model names the capability in the user's own terms ("changing a
   seat", "finding seats together"), which is what the later stages search for.
3. **Three probes, in parallel.** Each answers "does this exist?" from a different angle.
   - `docs` ("Checking the documentation") embeds the question and searches the project's chunks,
     ranking by similarity damped by how many of the question's words the passage uses. A sure
     hit and a sure miss need no model; the band between them is read by a small model that says
     whether the passage describes the product doing what was asked or a manual workaround. A
     scanned passage is discounted by how legibly the reader saw it, so a blurry scan cannot
     outvote clean text.
   - `interface` ("Looking at this page") is pure local matching of the keywords against the
     affordances the widget scanned off the live page. No model call, so it is fast and
     deterministic.
   - `repository` ("Checking known product capabilities") searches every control the site graph
     knows, then ranks the repository's file paths by keyword. Its evidence says how many pages
     and controls were searched, so an absence is proved against the product and not only against
     the page in front of the user. The key stays `repository`; the user-facing label names the
     capability, because a customer is asking what the product can do, not what is in a source
     tree.
4. **Route.** `routeProbes` decides without a model where it can: a documentation or interface hit
   means `answer`, and so does a control found anywhere on the site; code alone means `hedge`.
   When all three come back empty a reasoning model is asked to confirm absence, and only then
   does the turn become `absent`.
5. **Answer.** For `answer`, the candidate controls are gathered from the graph search, the
   documentation and the current page, and the route to each is computed over the graph first.
   The model chooses the target, writes the prose and writes the captions; it never counts steps,
   so "3 steps" is the length of the path. The first step is bound to a live affordance id the
   widget sent; later steps carry the control's identity and are bound by the widget when it gets
   there. `validatePlan` rejects the plan if a live id is unknown or a caption is too long. The
   resolved target becomes a known route. For `absent`, the model drafts a `FeatureRequest` and the
   widget offers to file it.

The three probes are the product. Answering confidently is easy; proving absence is what earns the
right to open a pull request.

A plan today is built from the affordances of the page in front of the user, so a route that
crosses pages is announced short and then re-planned after each navigation. The design that fixes
it is a site capability graph: discover the product's functional structure once, plan the route
over the graph, and re-bind to real nodes on arrival instead of asking a model again. The graph and
its route planner are being built on a parallel branch; `packages/widget/src/guide` owns the
binding and the spotlight, and `apps/web/lib/agent` owns the planning.

## Escalation

Accepting the offer inserts an `escalation` row for the engine named by `ESCALATION_ENGINE`.

- `local` leaves the row `queued`, and the worker's runner claims it. This is the simple-gap path:
  one process, one issue, one draft pull request.
- `forge` is the sandbox engine in `apps/web/lib/forge` for capability-scale work: two candidates
  build a compiled capability in parallel in isolated sandboxes, three Codex personas each, the
  verification result picks the winner, and the winner serves a preview and opens the draft pull
  request. The row waits `queued` until the opportunity has a compiled specification; the run
  starts from `POST /api/opportunities/:groupId/forge`. `POST /api/escalate` answers
  `503 {error, reason: "engine_unavailable"}` and writes nothing when the selected strategy has no
  keys. The engine, its three strategies (Reflex, Runloop, local) and its trust boundary are in
  `docs/forge.md`.

Between the verdict and the engine sits the opportunity pipeline (`apps/web/lib/opportunity`):
a `discovery` row per request group, enqueued by the request and executed by the runner
(`npm run discover:runner`) or after the response, that mines the sessions from PostHog and
compiles the Capability IR the engine builds from. The console's Opportunities page shows the
whole path for one group, in story order.

The dashboard never needs to know which engine ran. Every engine writes the same statuses and the
same trace events, so the console renders them identically.

A `local` run files the issue, inspects the repository, drafts the implementation, runs the target
repository's own typecheck and build as gates, opens a draft pull request, and then **pauses on a
human decision**. The console writes `escalation.approval`; approval merges and watches the
deployment until it is live. A `forge` run pauses the same way; on approval the forge runner marks
the pull request ready, merges it, watches the deployment and tears the winner's sandbox down.

### An approved request outranks the target repository's premise

The architect reads the target repository's own conventions before it plans anything, and a product
repository can hold a convention, a contract or a test whose whole content is that the requested
feature is absent. Read as instructions, those forbid the change: asked to build automatic group
seating in NovaAir, the architect answered with an empty file list and quoted `AGENTS.md` back,
"raise this rather than implementing it". Nothing shipped, and the trace only said "the architect
returned no files".

The issue reaching the worker is an approved decision. A human accepted the request in the console
before the run started, so the premise is what the change supersedes, not a veto over it. So:

- The architect is told the issue is an approved product decision, that it supersedes any premise,
  guard test or contract whose only content is the feature's absence, and that such a guard is part
  of the plan rather than a reason to refuse one.
- A planned file carries an action: `edit`, `create` or `delete`. A test that exists only to assert
  the feature is missing is planned for deletion, and `steps/applier.py` and `push_files` both carry
  a deletion through to the commit.
- The strict plan schema requires at least one file. An answer with none is a refusal rather than a
  failure, so it is retried once with the refusal named; a second empty answer raises, carrying the
  model's own words so the trace says why nothing was planned.

Everything else in the conventions still binds. Only the absence claim is superseded, never the
engineering standard around it.

Neither engine does that work inside an HTTP request. The routes write the `escalation` row and
answer; a long-lived process polls it and carries the run. For `local` that process is
`services/worker/local_runner.py`, for `forge` it is `npm run forge:runner`. A forge run takes tens
of minutes and a serverless function is capped at 300 s, so the split is what makes the hosted
console possible at all. See "Where a run actually runs" in `docs/forge.md`.

## Tracing

`trace_event` is an append-only log with a `bigserial` id that doubles as the SSE cursor. The
console backfills from `GET /api/trace` and then follows `GET /api/trace/stream`, which polls
Postgres, honours `Last-Event-ID`, and closes cleanly on a timer so `EventSource` reconnects on its
own. Because both the request path and the worker write to the same table, the console shows one
continuous story from the user's question to the live deployment.

Event `detail` payloads are free-form JSON. The console renders known shapes specially (probes with
scores, diffs with per-line colouring, the pause as an approve card) and falls back to a key/value
list for anything else, so a new event kind never breaks the page. The evidence loop reuses the
same table: the compiler's decision trail arrives as `capability` events, and the sandboxes report
as `candidate` and `preview` events from the `forge` source. `source` names the lane a row came from: `agent` for the chat turn, `workflow` for the
worker, `forge` for the sandbox engine.

## Data

Postgres with `pgvector`. One `project` row per customer, `document` and `chunk` for the knowledge
base, `site_page`, `affordance`, `transition` and `known_route` for the site graph, `conversation`
and `message` for chat history, `escalation` for the build pipeline, `candidate` for each sandbox
attempt of a forge run, `deployment_outcome` for what happened after a capability shipped, and
`trace_event` for everything observable. Row level security is enabled on every table with no
policies; the application only ever connects with the service role, which bypasses it. See
`docs/contracts.md` for the full schema.

## Design system

The dashboard and the widget share one visual language: warm paper, one moss accent, serif
headlines, and glass where a panel sits over the soft gradient behind the page.

- Backdrop: warm paper (`--paper`) with three very soft washes on a fixed layer behind the page
  (`--wash-green`, `--wash-moss`, `--wash-warm`). They are what the glass blurs.
- Glass: every frosted surface is the same recipe. A translucent paper fill (`--glass`, or
  `--glass-strong` for bars and menus), a 30 px backdrop blur (`--blur`), one hairline border
  (`--hairline`) and a light inner edge (`--glass-highlight`). The console bar, the panels, the
  cards, the sign-in card and the menus use it. On the landing page the frost is only where a
  panel overlaps something: the sticky header and the captions over the product captures. When
  a browser has no `backdrop-filter`, the same surfaces fall back to opaque paper.
- Type: Inter for body text, Newsreader for console headings, Fraunces for the landing page.
  Body text is 14 px or larger; captions and labels are 12 px or larger.
- One accent, `--accent` (`#2e6f54`) with `--accent-deep` for filled pills and deep panels. It
  is the primary action, the one italic word in a headline, and the spotlight ring. Nothing else
  is green.
- Status is text. A badge is a word on a soft tint, never a coloured pill without a word.
- The landing page shows the product: a real capture of the widget on a host page and a real
  capture of the console trace, with plain headings and few decorations. Step cards come into
  view as the page scrolls (`.reveal`), and stay visible without script.
- Motion only where it carries information, and everything honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Every colour, radius, shadow and blur is a token in the `:root` block at the top of
`apps/web/app/globals.css`; no component names a literal colour. A new page inherits the skin by
using the classes there (`.panel`, `.glass`, `.record-card`, `.primary-action` and so on) rather
than styling itself. The widget carries its own copy of the tokens (`--pl-*` in
`packages/widget/src/styles.ts`) inside its shadow root, so it can never inherit or leak host
styles; its panel and caption bubble are the same warm glass, and the ring is the accent.

It has to read on a projector, so contrast is measured on the rendered pixels rather than
assumed: the pull request that introduced the skin records the WCAG ratios for body text on
every surface.
