"""One reported gap is one GitHub issue, whatever order the runs reach GitHub in.

The night this was written, two runs for group a9619dda overlapped by four seconds: the first
filed issue #18 and the second, which had read the group a moment earlier and seen no issue
number, filed #19 for the same request. When the same two runs happened to be one second apart the
second one reused the issue, so the repository's second issue depended on nothing but timing.

The tests below drive that race directly: a fake group row that gains its `issue_number` only
after the first run files, and a second run that starts while the first is still filing.
